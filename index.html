    <p1>"I am a sophomore at Pennsylvania State University studying Human Centered Design and Development. My career goal is to help foster a professional environment <br>where field data, UI design, and software engineering can all seamlessly blend together to create positive user experiences.<br>

        I have recently started the application focus portion of my degree which allows us to explore an alternative field of study that we believe we can apply to our <br>career. I chose Healthcare because I am deeply passionate about taking out the bureaucracy and confusion that patients of the US <br>healthcare system may find online. When it comes to both mental and physical health, I want to find ways to make the user experience of those trying to care of themselves a positive one.<br>

        Last semester I worked on a group project where I designed a mobile application that centralized multiple online mental health resources into a single application. <br>This project took us through the design thinking stages of empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, test, and implementing <br>which ultimately resulted in a Figma prototype.

        I am currently programming this concept to life and look forward to working on more projects where I can explore user experience and UI <br>design within the world of Healthcare and other fields."</p1>
